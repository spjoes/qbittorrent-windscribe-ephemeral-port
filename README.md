## Introduction
Automatically create ephemeral ports in windscribe and update qbittorrent config to use the new port.
Also exports the new port as iptables rule for Gluetun.

This repo is for qbittorrent only. For Deluge, check out the original repo this qbittorrent version is forked from: [deluge-windscribe-ephemeral-port](https://github.com/dumbasPL/deluge-windscribe-ephemeral-port)

## Prerequisites
Before using this project, you must deploy [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr). 
FlareSolverr is a proxy server that is used to bypass Cloudflare challenge, which is required to Windscribe's login. 
Without FlareSolverr, the script cannot successfully authenticate due to Cloudflare's bot mitigation. 

Deploy it on your server (e.g., via Docker) and ensure it’s accessible to this script.

## Important information
This project was designed to work along side containers like [linuxserver/qbittorrent](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-qbittorrent) in mind.  
It will not help you route qbittorrent traffic through a VPN! For that, you can use [qdm12/gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun). What it will do is to update the listening port of qbittorrent and export iptables rules for Gluetun.

## Gluetun compatibility
If you want the Gluetun container to pick up the iptables changes, you have to restart it. This project can do it for you, but to use it you **must** mount the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into this container.
> **Warning:** Mounting the Docker socket gives the container full control of your Docker host.  
> Only use this feature if you trust the container and code!

# Configuration
Configuration is done using environment variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| WINDSCRIBE_USERNAME | username you use to login at windscribe.com/login | YES |  |
| WINDSCRIBE_PASSWORD | password you use to login at windscribe.com/login | YES |  |
| WINDSCRIBE_TOTP_SECRET | TOTP secret for 2FA authentication (Base32 encoded). Required if 2FA is enabled on your Windscribe account. See [2FA Setup](#2fa-setup) | NO |  |
| FLARESOLVERR_URL | The URL of [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) to bypass Cloudflare challenge | YES |  | 
| CLIENT_URL | The URL for the qbittorrent web UI (eg: http://localhost:8080) | YES |  |
| CLIENT_USERNAME | The username for the qbittorrent web UI | YES |  |
| CLIENT_PASSWORD | The password for the qbittorrent web UI | YES |  |
| WINDSCRIBE_EPHEMERAL_INTERNAL_PORT | Specific internal ephemeral port to request from Windscribe. Leave unset or set to `0` to request a matching port automatically. | NO | 0 |
| CRON_SCHEDULE | An extra cron schedule used to periodically validate and update the port if needed. Disabled if left empty | NO |  |
| WINDSCRIBE_RETRY_DELAY | how long to wait (in milliseconds) before retrying after a windscribe error. For example a failed login. | NO | 3600000 (1 hour) |
| WINDSCRIBE_EXTRA_DELAY | how long to wait (in milliseconds) after the ephemeral port expires before trying to create a new one. | NO | 60000 (1 minute) |
| CLIENT_RETRY_DELAY | how long to wait (in milliseconds) before retrying after a qbittorrent error. For example a failed login. | NO | 300000 (5 minutes) |
| CACHE_DIR | A directory where to store cached data like windscribe session cookies | NO | `/cache` in the docker container and `./cache` everywhere else |
| GLUETUN_DIR | A directory where to write iptables entry for gluetun | NO | `/post-rules.txt` in the docker container and `./post-rules.txt` everywhere else |
| GLUETUN_IFACE | Gluetun vpn interface name | NO | `tun0` |
| GLUETUN_CONTAINER_NAME | Name of the Gluetun Docker container to restart. If set, the app will try to restart the container after updating iptables rules. Both container names are required | NO | |
| QBITTORRENT_CONTAINER_NAME | Name of the qbittorrent Docker container to restart. If set, the app will try to restart the container after updating iptables rules. Both container names are required | NO | |

## 2FA Setup

If you have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on your Windscribe account, you need to provide the TOTP secret so this application can generate authentication codes automatically.

When you set up 2FA in Windscribe, you're shown a QR code. This QR code contains a URI like:
```
otpauth://totp/Windscribe:yourusername?secret=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP&issuer=Windscribe
```

You need to extract the `secret=XXX` value from this URI. Some authenticator apps allow you to view the secret. Or you can decode the QR code.  
The secret is a Base32-encoded string (uppercase letters A-Z and digits 2-7). Set it as `WINDSCRIBE_TOTP_SECRET` in your configuration.

# Running
## Using docker (and docker compose in this example)

```yaml

    volumes:
      - windscribe-cache:/cache
      # optional
      # - ./post-rules.txt:/app/post-rules.txt
      # mounting docker socket is required for container restart feature
      # - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - WINDSCRIBE_USERNAME=<your windscribe username>
      - WINDSCRIBE_PASSWORD=<your windscribe password>
      - FLARESOLVERR_URL=http://flaresolverr:8191/v1
      - CLIENT_URL=<url of your qbittorrent Web UI>
